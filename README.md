# Wikipedia-Go

I contributed to the development of a website built with Go language that serves as a Wikipedia clone. 
The website allows users to create, read, update, and delete articles. 
We used Postgresql as our database and Docker for running the application. 
During our university's 4th semester, I primarily worked on the frontend development of this project.
